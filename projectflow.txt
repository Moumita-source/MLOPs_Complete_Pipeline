Building Pipeline :
1. Create a github repo and clone it in local (Add experiments).
2. Add src folder along with all components (run them indiviually).
3. Add data, models, reports directories to .gitignore file
4. Now git add, commit, push

Setting up dvc pipeline (without params)
a. Create dvc.yaml file and add stages to it
b. "dvc init" then do "dvc repro" to test the pipeline automation. (check dvc dag)
c. Now git add, commit, push

Setting up dvc pipeline (with params)
a. add params.yaml file
b. Add the params setup (mentioned below)
c. Do 'dvc repro' again to test the pipeline along with the params
d. Now git add, commit, push

Experiments with DVC:
a. pip install dvclive
b. Add the dvclive code block (mentioned below)
c. Do "dvc exp run", it will create a new dvc.yaml(if already not there) and dvclive directory (each
   run will be considered as an experiment)
d. Do "dvc exp show" on terminal to see the experiments or use extension on VSCode (install dvc extension)
e. Do "dvc exp remove {exp-name}" to remove exp (optional) | "dvc exp apply {exp-name}" to reproduce prev exp
f. Change params, re-run code (produce new experiments)
g. Now git add, commit, push   

Adding a remote S3 storage to DVC
a. Login to AWS console
b. Create an IAM user (straight forward process)
c. Create S3 (enter unique name and create)
d. pip install dvc[s3]
e. pip install awscli
f. "aws configure" on terminal
g. dvc remote add -d dvcstore s3://bucketname
h. dvc commit-push the exp you want to keep
i. Finally, git add, commit, push
